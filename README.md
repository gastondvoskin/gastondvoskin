# Hi! I'm GastÃ³n Dvoskin ðŸ‘‹
### Front-end developer

<br /> 

## :man_technologist: ABOUT ME

Iâ€™m a Front-end developer with an advanced proficiency in English (C2). I graduated as a Full-stack web developer from Soy Henry, where I currently work as a Teaching Assistant, guiding students in solving exercises and promoting teamwork.

I am experienced in both front-end and full-stack Single Page Applications development using Agile methodologies and technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, CSS, Tailwind, MaterialUI, NodeJS, Express, and Sequelize. 

Specialized in Front-end, I am committed to creating websites that adapt to any device and offer an excellent user experience. Through careful consideration of design principles, I ensure that every element on the screen serves a purpose and contributes to an intuitive navigation flow, providing users with a smooth and pleasant journey.

Additionally, my experience as a Director of cultural projects for a decade has provided me with leadership skills, planning abilities, brand development, institutional representation, and fundraising expertise. Since graduating as a Bachelor of Musical Sound Arts from the National University of the Arts, five projects under my direction have been recognized as of Cultural Interest for the City of Buenos Aires, and I have received awards from the National Arts Fund of Argentina, National Music Institute of Argentina, and Mozarteum.

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities to contribute my skills as a front-end developer to an organization where I can continue learning and growing professionally. I am eager to work in a team and take on new challenges in my career path.
