# Hi! I'm GastÃ³n Dvoskin ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a Full-stack web developer

<br /> 

## :man_technologist: ABOUT ME

My passion for project management and entrepreneurship led me to seek ways to optimize time and systematize processes to achieve a greater impact. That's how programming entered my life, as a powerful tool to enhance the projects I have been leading over the past 10 years.

I graduated as a Full-stack web developer from Soy Henry, where I currently work as a Teaching Assistant, guiding students in solving exercises and promoting teamwork.

I have experience in developing Single Page Applications using agile methodologies and technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, NodeJs, Express, and Sequelize. My English proficiency level is C2 (Advanced).

Additionally, my experience as a Director of cultural projects for a decade has provided me with leadership skills, planning abilities, brand development, institutional representation, and fundraising expertise. Since graduating as a Bachelor of Musical Sound Arts from the National University of the Arts, five projects under my direction have been recognized as of Cultural Interest for the City of Buenos Aires, and I have received awards for my work as a Director of cultural projects from the National Arts Fund of Argentina, National Music Institute of Argentina, and Mozarteum.

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities to contribute my skills as a web developer to an organization where I can continue learning and growing professionally. I am eager to work in a team and take on new challenges in my career path.
